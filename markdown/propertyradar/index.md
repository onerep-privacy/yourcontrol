<div class="list-style-bullet"></div>

- **Residents of all states** can request an opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
- **Residents of some states** can request the deletion of their personal information. While PropertyRadar doesn’t mention which states are eligible, they are likely to be California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Montana, Oregon, and Texas, as these states have enacted relevant privacy legislation.
- **The rights to opt out and delete don’t apply to publicly available information** or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern. PropertyRadar considers much of the personal information they offer in their products to be publicly available information.
