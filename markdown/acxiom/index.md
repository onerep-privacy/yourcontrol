### Removal options
When it comes to privacy choices, Acxiom provides two main options: **the right to opt out** and **the right to delete**. The first option prevents Acxiom from selling your personal information to third parties, while the second requires that they delete all the personal information collected about you.

⚠️ **Note:** Some states have additional rights such as limiting the use or opting out of the processing of sensitive personal data. However, Acxiom treats such requests as a deletion request. Thus, you can simply exercise your Right to Delete without submitting any additional requests.
