### Removal options
You can request Enformion to **delete your data** and **opt out of the sale** of your personal information, though the process may vary depending on consumer privacy laws governing your specific state (like CCPA, VCDPA, etc). 

However, even if your state doesn't have relevant legislation, Enformion still typically allows all individuals to request the deletion and opt-out as part of their standard privacy practices.

## How to submit privacy requests

To exercise your rights, access Enformion’s [“Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page](https://www.enformion.com/opt-out/).

- **To opt out of the sale of your personal information**, click on the “Opt-Out Form”, fill it out with your data, and submit it.
- **To request the deletion of your personal information**, open the “Right to Delete Form”, fill it out with your data, and submit it.


Once you submit the form, you should be notified that ticket creation was successful. Further communications and confirmations from Enformion should come via the provided email.

Note that you might need to provide some form of identity verification to ensure that they remove the correct records associated with you.
