### Removal options

It is generally impossible to completely delete all your data from Experian, as it is a credit reporting agency and is permitted to maintain certain information. However, the company provides the privacy options that allow you to:

- **Opt out** of the sale of your personal information and data, opt out of processing your data for targeted advertising, and limit the use of your sensitive information.
- **Delete** the personal data you have provided to Experian in the past.

⚠️ **Important:** Exercising the described-above options will not affect your credit report and score.

## How to exercise your rights

Both deletion and opt-out requests are submitted using the same form. However, Experian accepts only one request at a time - you can submit another one when the first is completed.
