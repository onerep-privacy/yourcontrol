- **Request deletion** of data that relates to you.
- **Opt out of sale/ sharing** of your data for marketing purposes.

There is also an option to opt out of use of your sensitive data. However, Zeta treats them as data deletion requests, so you only need to submit the latter.

## How to exercise your rights on Zeta Global

Both deletion and opt-out requests are submitted via the same form.

⚠️ **Things to know before you start:**

2. You must submit a separate request for each email account you use as Zeta organizes databases around email addresses.
