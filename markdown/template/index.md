- **All consumers** can request a disclosure report to review their data. However, if your state lacks privacy laws, you can only correct errors, not remove or opt out of data sharing.
- **Residents of Nevada** can opt out of the sale/ sharing of their personal information with third parties. To do this, select “Opt-Out” when submitting the form.




### ⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Important
1. You must provide proof of identity, such as a driver’s license or utility bill, showing your name and current address.
2. Removal requests are often denied as legal records are usually exempt from removal or suppression.
