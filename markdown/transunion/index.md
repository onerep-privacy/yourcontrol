### Removal options

Since TransUnion is a credit reporting agency as defined by FCRA, it is permitted to maintain certain data for credit reporting and background screening purposes, meaning you can’t delete all the information it maintains. 

However, the company provides an “**Opt-out or limit use of data**” option. This will opt you out of the sale/sharing of your personal information, cross-context behavioral advertising/targeted advertising, and automated decision-making/profiling, and limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
