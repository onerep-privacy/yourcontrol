Pipl aggregates information from various online sources and compiles comprehensive digital profiles. It is widely used by businesses for identity verification, background checks, and investigative purposes.

### Removal options
Pipl provides an opt-out process that allows you to exclude certain information from their services. The company notes, however, that there may be situations where their need for identity verification and fraud prevention may override your right to have data removed.

## How to submit an opt-out request

To request an opt-out, you need to fill out and submit the [online form](https://pipl.com/personal-information-removal-request). 

⚠️ **Note:** Two removal types are available: “Deletion” and “Deletion + Disclosure.” While the second one implies they will disclose what data they maintain, in our experience, there was no difference between the two and we didn’t receive any reports with the second type.
