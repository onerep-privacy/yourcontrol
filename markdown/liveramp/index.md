- **Residents of all states** can opt out of the processing, disclosure, sale, and sharing of their data, and the use/disclosure of sensitive personal information.
- **Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, Utah, Oregon, Texas, and Montana** can additionally request the deletion of their personal information.

## How to exercise your rights

⚠️ **Important:** If your goal is to minimize personalized ads by LiveRamp customers and otherwise minimize their ability to transfer personal information about you, you should submit an opt-out request instead of, or before submitting, a deletion request.

Both the opt-out and deletion request are submitted via [the same form](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/697ea013-8e66-44aa-94c5-fa9d38dd439c).

- **Deletion requests:** Require identity and email verification - you’ll be asked to answer a couple of identity verification questions during the process, then emailed a verification link. Your request should be processed within 45 days.
